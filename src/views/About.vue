    Hi there ðŸ™‚, my name is Leke, an avid reader and consumer of books. I love how reading serves as
    an escape into my mind where stories unfold and different tales are woven. It always feels to me
    like the books are movies playing in my mind and I get to watch them in HD. I have always loved
    books right from an early age. I remember reading the bible when younger, say 9 or 10, not
    because I was looking for spiritual nourishment ðŸ˜‚ but because of the stories in the old
    testament. I also liked to just pick up the dictionary and learn about different words I did not
    know. <br /><br />

    I enjoy reading fantasy, thriller and legal books. Fantasy specifically is a major highlight for
    me. I think it's incredible how fantasy authors are able to create entirely new worlds and
    systems, either blending the real world with their novel concepts or flipping the script
    entirely and coming up with something completely new. Recently though, I've been trying to
    diversity my interests by dipping my toes into romance. These were words I never thought I would
    say but eehh I guess they are not so unpalatable, especially when the story is incorporated into
    other overarching themes beyond romance - Francine Rivers' Mark of the Lion series does this
    excellently. I could just roll my eyes at the romance bits because of how good the overall story
    was. <br /><br />

    My favorite authors are Brandon Sanderson (Stormlight Archive, Mistborn), Ted Dekker (The Circle
    Trilogy, Thr3e) and John Grisham (The Rainmaker, The Testament). I also really enjoy books that
    weave in themes of faith and christianity. Books that are able to draw allegories which reveal
    deeper faith based messages. The Circle Trilogy and Mark of the Lion are great examples of this.
    I built this blog to serve as an expression of my love for books and also as an avenue to work
    through my thoughts, feelings and opinions about books when I finish them. <br /><br />
